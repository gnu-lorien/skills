## What it does

`setup-matt-pocock-skills` configures where issues live, what triage labels are called, where domain docs sit, and optional execution profiles for parallel implementation. It records the answers under `docs/agents/` and generates supporting agents when model dispatch is configured.

Those files are the only thing that varies between repos. The skills themselves are identical everywhere. They read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` at run time and do what it says. That is why the set is not tied to GitHub, and why you never edit a skill file to point it at another tracker. Invoking it with "link the skills to a custom issue tracker" works with anything you can connect to programmatically, with no changes to the skills.

It is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. It reads your `git remote`, `CLAUDE.md` and `GLOSSARY.md`, proposes what it found, and waits for you to confirm before it writes anything.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`; the [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent) won't reach for it on its own. Its metadata marks it non-invokable on purpose, so no other skill can fire it for you.

Reach for it once per repo, before the first use of any other engineering skill. If [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) or [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) start guessing where your issues go, or apply labels your tracker doesn't have, this repo has not been set up yet. You can run it in a repo halfway through a project. The skill reads what is already there, so no earlier work is lost.

## Prerequisites

It writes into the repo you run it in:

| It writes | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `issue-tracker.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `domain.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `triage-labels.md` | `docs/agents/`, only when the `triage` skill is installed |
| `execution.json`, shared implementer contract, and ownership manifest | `docs/agents/`, when execution profiles are configured |
| Native implementer definitions | `.claude/agents/` and/or `.codex/agents/`, for configured harnesses |
| An `## Agent skills` block | whichever of `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` already exists |

Commit the configuration and generated agents together. There is no user-level or global mode. The config lives in the repo, so every repo gets its own copy.

## The configuration decisions

It starts each section with the recommended answer, and skips any question its exploration already answered. Most runs need only two confirmations.

| Decision | What it proposes | When it asks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Issue tracker** | the one matching your `git remote` | always, because this is the one real choice |
| **Triage labels** | keep the five canonical names (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) | only if the `triage` skill is installed |
| **Domain docs** | single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` plus `docs/adr/` at the root | only if it spots monorepo signals, and then it offers a multi-context `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` |
| **Execution profiles** | project choices for models, efforts, and the review-fix profile | when `implement-spec` is installed or model dispatch is requested |

The tracker options:

| Option | Where issues live | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub** | the repo's GitHub Issues | the `gh` CLI |
| **GitLab** | the repo's GitLab Issues | the `glab` CLI |
| **Local markdown** | files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo | nothing, not even a remote |
| **Other** | wherever you say | one paragraph from you describing the workflow |

The first three ship as templates in the skill and work out of the box. Local markdown is a full option, not a fallback. The skill supports a solo project with no remote. One caveat: don't use local markdown if you use GitHub. They are alternatives, so pick one.

"Other" is a full option too. It is how Jira, Linear, Azure DevOps and Beads all work. You describe the workflow, the skill records your prose in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, and the downstream skills follow the prose. Users have already built this: a Jira-over-[MCP](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/mcp) variant, a Gitea CLI shaped like `gh`, a hand-built local dashboard.

## Common questions

**Does installing the skill also install its Claude Code and Codex agents?**

No. Setup generates project-scoped native definitions from your approved execution profiles and copies a shared implementer contract into the project. It verifies model and effort support against the installed clients and account, preserves custom agents, and refuses to overwrite edited generated definitions. Updating profiles or the contract requires regeneration. New agent definitions may need a fresh client session before discovery. The generator validates configuration and writes files; it does not prove that a model is available to your account.

After generation, setup runs no-edit probes for the default and review-fix profiles in the active client and checks captured runtime evidence with the preflight helper. A second configured harness remains unverified until checked in its own client. Missing discovery or effective-setting metadata leaves live verification pending. [implement-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement-spec) repeats preflight for every combination its tickets need in each new session.

**Do I have to use GitHub?**

No. GitHub, GitLab and local markdown under `.scratch/` all ship as ready-made templates, and anything else works through the "other" path. This is the most-repeated question, in roughly these words: *"hard locked to github"*, *"can I use GitLab / Jira"*, *"what about Azure DevOps"*. The answer is always the same: setup chooses the tracker, not the skill.

**Do I need to re-run it after updating the skills?**

The direct answer after v1.1 was yes. The skill's own closing message is softer. It tells you to re-run only to switch trackers or start over. Both are defensible. The seed templates change between versions, so a `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from an older release can go out of date against the skills that now read it. If a downstream skill does something different from what the docs describe, re-run setup. It is cheap.

**It wrote to `CLAUDE.md`, but I'm on Codex.**

This is a known gap, and still open. The file-selection rule is "edit `CLAUDE.md` if it exists, else `AGENTS.md`". It checks which file exists, not which [harness](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness) is running. In a repo with a `CLAUDE.md` left over from Claude Code, the skill writes its `## Agent skills` block to a file Codex never reads. Users have two workarounds: move the block to `AGENTS.md` by hand, or keep `AGENTS.md` canonical and make `CLAUDE.md` a one-line pointer at it. If neither file exists, the skill asks you which to create instead of picking one. This has confused people who expected it to decide.

**It didn't create my triage labels.**

It doesn't. `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` is a *mapping*: it tells `/triage` which strings in your tracker correspond to the five canonical roles. It does not run `gh label create`. On a fresh GitHub repo the labels do not exist yet, and users have filed this as a bug more than once. Two consequences:

- If your tracker already uses the canonical names, the mapping is an identity table and there is nothing to configure. That is the intended common case, not a missing step.
- This skill does not create [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder)'s `wayfinder:map` and `wayfinder:<type>` labels either, and `gh issue create --label <missing>` fails instead of creating the label. Create them by hand before the first wayfinder run on a GitHub repo.

**Can I configure the other skills' behaviour here ([grilling](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/grilling) cadence, question format, tone)?**

It configures tracker, labels, doc layout, and optional execution profiles. General preferences such as cadence, tone, or question format belong in your steering file. Execution profiles configure the runtime model and effort, while the shared implementation rules stay identical across harnesses.

**Can I keep the config in `~/.claude` instead of committing it to every repo?**

Not today. A user who runs the skills across many repos has an open request for this, but no user-level mode exists. Every repo carries its own `docs/agents/`.

**Isn't it strange to have a skill that configures the other skills?**

One long-standing complaint says yes, in these words: *"having a skill to set up the other skill does not feel right to me: that means the LLM is configuring its own skills."* The trade-off is real. Without a setup step, every skill that touches issues would need its own copy of the tracker instructions. The output is markdown you can read and edit, and that limits the risk. You can read every file it wrote and change it by hand. Make day-to-day changes that way, not with another run.

## It's working if

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/domain.md` exist, plus `triage-labels.md` if `triage` is installed.
- An `## Agent skills` section appears in the instruction file your harness reads, with a one-line summary pointing at each of those files.
- The tracker it proposed matches the remote you use, and the label strings match labels that exist in your tracker.
- Afterwards, `/to-tickets` publishes without asking you where issues live, and `/triage` applies labels rather than inventing them.
- Nothing in the skill files themselves changed. If setup edited a `SKILL.md`, something went wrong.

## Where it fits

`setup-matt-pocock-skills` is the **run-once setup** for the engineering flow, the precondition everything else assumes rather than a step in the chain. Its neighbours are its readers: [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), which applies the label vocabulary written here; [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec) and [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which publish into the tracker named here; and [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder), which reads the "Wayfinding operations" section of the same tracker file to learn how to store maps and child [tickets](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket). [domain-modeling](https://aihero.dev/skills-domain-modeling) later fills in the domain-doc layout that setup records. It creates `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs only when you resolve a term or decision, so a repo with no domain docs after setup is normal. For which skill to reach for next, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes the whole set.
